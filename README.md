## Instructions
*(read these instructions also on the [website](https://webdeckplayer.neocities.org))*

Getting started with the Webdeck Player is very simple. Follow this tutorial and you'll get your copy of the player running in a few minutes!


### Installing the player
1. Go to the Releases section of the Github repository and download the latest version available. You should get a `webdeck-player-v.X.X.X.zip` file.
2. Unzip the file and put the `webdeck-player` folder into your website root folder.

3. a. **Run the player on a separate browser window (recommended)**
  - The player is designed to work inside a container of 600x250 pixels. You can make the player open in a new browser window - it will look great and visitors can navigate the rest of your site while keeping the player running! To do it, place a tag like the following in your site:  
`<button onclick="window.open('/webdeck-player/index.html', 'Web Deck Player', 'height=250, width=600')">Open Web Deck Player</button>`  
This code creates a button that will open a window with the specified height and width containing the player.

3. b. **Run the player inside an iframe**
  - You can also run the player inside a page of your site using an iframe tag. To do it, you can write the following tag in the HTML of your page:  
`<iframe src="/webdeck-player/index.html" height="250" width="600" scrolling="no"></iframe>`  

### Adding playlists

Go to the `script.js` file inside the webdeck-player folder. There you can follow the instructions to change the playlists shown in the player.

### Adding themes

To add a new theme to the player, copy its folder to the themes folder. Then, open the `script.js` file and add it to the list following the instructions.

### Creating a new theme

Themes are just a collection of resources (like images or fonts) and a CSS file to modify the player appearance. You just need basic knowledge about CSS to start! Create a new theme following these steps:

1. Inside the `webdeck-player` folder, locate the themes folder and open it.
2. Choose a theme folder as a base, for example, the default theme. You can modify any other theme.
3. Duplicate your chosen folder and rename it. For example, call it `my-theme`.
4. Add your new theme to the `script.js` file following the instructions inside it.
5. Inside your theme folder, open the `webdeck-player.css` file and modify it to your liking. You can also change the fonts and the images. **Do not rename any image.** Their paths are used in the `script.js` file. The `about.txt` file is for adding a description about the theme and your name.
